- 👋 Hi, I’m @ricraftis
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things it's hard to list them, but includes life-long learning, computers, IT, Internet, AI etc.
- 🌱 I’m recently completed my MBA at the Australian Institute of Business in Adelaide and about to commence a doctorate research project on the ability of community leadership training to build the social fabric or rural and regional commmunities.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at this stage, but always open to ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me.... you'll find me on LinkedIn
